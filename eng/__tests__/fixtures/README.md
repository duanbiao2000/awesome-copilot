# Educational Note: Test Fixtures

#

# This directory contains test fixtures used by the yaml-parser-optimized.test.js test suite

# Fixtures provide consistent test data across multiple test runs, ensuring

# tests are repeatable and independent of the actual file system

#

# Each fixture file has a specific purpose

# - valid-collection.yml: A properly formatted YAML collection file

# - invalid-collection.yml: A YAML file with syntax errors

# - valid-markdown.md: A markdown file with valid frontmatter

# - sample-agent.md: An agent file with MCP server configurations
