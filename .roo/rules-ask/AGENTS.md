# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- The `eng/` directory contains the core logic for the documentation generator.
- The `collections/` directory contains `.collection.yml` files that define how content is grouped.
- The `docs/` directory contains the generated documentation. Do not edit these files directly.
