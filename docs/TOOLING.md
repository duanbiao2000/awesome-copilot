Documents best practices  The content is organized into sections: • Core Tools Overview (each tool's purpose) • Common Workflows (step-by-step guides) • Validation Rules (what's checked) • Documentation Structure (output organization) • Troubleshooting (common issues) • Best Practices (recommended patterns) • Tool Options Reference (detailed command usage)
